# Instructor Survey Platform

A full-stack web application to streamline the administration, delivery, and reporting of student surveys for college instructors. Built using **Next.js**, **Supabase**, and **Qualtrics**, , the platform allows instructors to create accounts, launch surveys, and receive reports, while giving internal team members administrative oversight and automation tools.

## üöÄ Goals / Milestones

- Instructors can:

| Milestone | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| ‚úÖ Profile | Update profile upon signup | In Progress |


### üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Next steps
 - [X] Create a profile database table
 - [X] Fix the auto email linking
 - [ ] Create a profile page with next steps (upon signup)
 - [ ] Create a profile update page ()

 ### Optional features
 - [ ] User can upload a profile picture
 - [ ] User can upload a Bio  


### Profile Schema

Extends¬†`auth.users` with additional fields for instructor profiles. The `user_id` column is a foreign key reference to the `auth.users` table, which is created by Supabase.

Optional columns are required for the profile to be considered complete. The `profile_name` column is a unique identifier for the instructor's profile and is generated using a random word generator if not provided. The `user_edited` column tracks whether the profile has been updated by the user, and the `consent` column indicates whether the user has consented to research.

For roles, `member` is the default role for sign-ups that allows them to access all features of the platform. The `admin` role is reserved for internal team members and has additional privileges. The `lead` role is for instructors who have been designated as leads for a specific course or program that have the ability to invite others and see their reports. The `basic` role is for a future feature that allows instructors to use surveys but with limited reporting.

| `job_title` | `text` | yes | Optional |
| `department` | `text` | yes | Optional |
| `institution` | `text` | yes | Optional |
| `role` | `text` | no | `'basic'¬†‚à£ 'member'¬†'lead' ‚à£ 'admin'` (default¬†`instructor`) |
| `user_edited` | `boolean` | no | Has this profile ever been updated? (default¬†`false`) |

#### SQL Tables
create table profiles (
  id uuid primary key references auth.users(id),
  email text not null default 'error@error.com',
  profile_name text not null unique default random_profile(),
  first_name text,
  last_name text,
  job_title text,
  department text,
  institution text,
  role text default 'member' check (role IN ('basic','member','lead','admin')),
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default now(),

  consent boolean default false
);



SQL Functions


Trigger profiles_sync_email BEFORE INSTERT on profiles (ROW)

```sql
BEGIN
  -- Only overwrite if email was not explicitly provided
  IF NEW.email IS NULL OR NEW.email = '' OR NEW.email = 'error@error.com' THEN
    SELECT auth.users.email
      INTO NEW.email
      FROM auth.users
     WHERE auth.users.id = NEW.id;
  END IF;

  RETURN NEW;
END;
```

Called on every insert to the profiles table. 
```sql
DECLARE
  hex_part text;
BEGIN
  -- Generate an 8-character hex string from a random number‚Äôs MD5 hash
  hex_part := substr(md5(random()::text), 1, 8);
  
  -- Prefix with whatever label you like (e.g., "member_" instead of "instructor_")
  RETURN 'member_' || hex_part;
END;
